## File Breakdown

- **API**: The app fetches questions from the Open Trivia Database API (https://opentdb.com).

## API Used

The quiz fetches questions from the Open Trivia Database (https://opentdb.com), a free-to-use trivia API.

- Endpoint: `https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&category=15&difficulty=easy&type=multiple`
- This endpoint returns 10 multiple-choice questions from the "Entertainment: Video Games" category, with easy difficulty.

## How It Works

1. When the user clicks the "Start Quiz" button, the app navigates to the question page and fetches 10 trivia questions from the API.
2. Each question is displayed with multiple-choice options. The user selects an answer and clicks "Next" to proceed to the next question.
3. After answering all the questions, the results page shows how many correct answers the user got.
4. The quiz statistics are saved in `localStorage`, which tracks how many correct answers were given for each quiz session.
5. A bar chart displays the userâ€™s performance over the last six quizzes, with the number of correct answers shown on the y-axis.
